# 2. Blockchain Concensus
# What is a concensus algorithm?
- Provide continuous check on the integrity of both 
	(1) New data blocks
	(2) Past ledger transactions
	
- Rules defined for every blockchain application for generating new blocks:
	(1) Validate legitimacy of new blocks before adding to chain
	(2) Apply to all nodes (aka blockchain's network)
	(3) Processes for validating new blocks of data - written in computer code using algorithms 
	
# Consensus mechanism
## Public blockchain
### Proof-of-Work (PoW)
- Uses scheme of rewards to encourage users to participate in minding
- Simply "solve puzzles", gain rights and earn rewards for efforts such as fees

### Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- Define privileges according to the actual known investment of users

## Private blockchain
Less complex or computer intensive consensus

- **Proof-of-Authority (PoA)**, that verifies the identity of the node
- Simple delegation of authority to those trusted nodes to accept new blocks
- Allow authenticated nodes to publish new blocks at will or rotational basis.

:exclamation: When users on the blockchain do not stick to accepted procedure on the network, the user loses credibility and user's reputation drops, probability of publishing a block also drops. In reality, all this is dynamic and block creation rates can be fast.


# Blockchain Concensus Security
# Proof-of-Work (PoW) Security
- When a block mathematical puzzle is 'solved' by miners, the transactions contained in that block are considered **validated**
- Miners receive some rewards when they solve the complex mathematical problem

- In short, the 'maths' problem is distributed to all Generals (Byzantine Generals Problem)
- Solution is integrated to the next PoW problem block.
- Block is created each time a General solves a PoW problem
- A General solves the problem of PoW - everyone elses would eventually solve theirs and know approximately how long it takes for Generals to solve the problem, and if they are still working on the same chain.

## Security of PoW
- Principle that **no entity** should obtain more than 50% of the total hashing or computing power 

### 51% vulnerability
- If an attacker have e.g. 51% of the total hashing power the following can be exploited
> Inject false transactions
> Exploit Blockchain network
> Eliminate all other users from network
> Perform double-spending
> Steal assets from other users

:exclamation: GHash.io alone dominated 54% of the whole BTC network processing power for a day

## Attacking PoW
### Double-spending attacks
Attacker use same coins to issue two or more transaction, spending More than they actually own. If transaction gets more approval, the less likely the transaction will be reversed in future

### Selfish mining
Miners raise their porportional mining share by selecting withholding mined blocks and then publishign them progressively. It is possible for an attacker with 33% mining power to use this method to earn 50% of the mining power.

:exclaimation: When all nodes in the blockchain are tightly synchronized, these attacks can be mitigated.

# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- Unlike Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake chooses the creator of a new block in a deterministic way (depending on its wealth or stake)

![](Pasted%20image%2020220417141623.png)

- Like PoW, this consensus protocol also seek to address the problem of Byzantine Generals.
- Solutions had been deployed by a few PoS-based networks that avoid **double spending attacks** and other security vulnerabilities that could arise due to Byzantine failures.

:exclamation: Ethereum 2.0 (Senerity) have a PoS algorithm named Casper which allow nodes to achieve consensus with a two-thirds majority before blocks can be formed.

## Security of PoS
- Principle that no entity should obtain more than 50 percent of digital asset

:exclamation: PoS is said to be an offer option for the **51% vulnerability**

Security features:
- **Penalties for attackers:** (1) validator will lose all confidence e.g. to be able to publish a new block (2) Depletion of cryptocurrency valuation - loss of attacker's net worth
- **Barriers to 51 percent stake** (1) buying 51 % stake in one go will have increased difficulty. (2) Coin demand drives up price, making it a very expensive choice.

## Attacking PoS

Similar to PoW

### Double-spending attacks
Attacker use same coins to issue two or more transaction, spending More than they actually own. If transaction gets more approval, the less likely the transaction will be reversed in future

Selfish mining is not possible as there is no reward for miners unlike for PoW. Also, the new PoS Casper protocol impose penalties on malicious actors


# Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) 

- 3 Groups of people; (1) Consumers (2) Delegates - administer (3) Witness secure network
- Consumers vote for **witnesses** to secure their network
- More tokens one hold = Stronger vote strength e.g Rich are powerful
- If witness are bad, people in community can remove their votes (or fire them)
- Delegates are elected in a manner similar to witness. They administer the network. But can recommend change in size of block or rewards paid by a witness in exchange for validation of a block. Consumers vote whether to implement them.

## Pros
- Strong protection against doublespending
- More democratic, easier to participate in vote (lesser stake held by user)
- More decentralization as more people can particpate (due to low entry threshold)
- Dont need high amounts of power to run network
- Seperates election of block producers from block production
- Provide basis for implementing governance models

## Cons
- Delegators need to be well informed and appoint honest witnesses
- Restricted no of witness can lead to heavy centralization of network
- Vulnerable to weighted voting - smaller stake voters may not take part in voting with possiblity that their "vote wont matter"
