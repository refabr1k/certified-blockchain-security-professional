# 1. Introduction
## What is blockchain?
- Transaction record database that is distributed
- Decentralized (no one entity maintaining it)
- P2P (peer to peer) network


## When Transactions happen
- New transactions are added into a 'ledger' but this ledger is tamper proof
	- Permanently stores data in sequential link of cryptographic links (called blocks)
	- Shared between all member nodes of network
	- Verified and validated
	- Added to the start of the chain
- Peers in a blockchain uses an agreed protocol.

## How data integrity is ensured
- **Integrity** of data is ensured via Crptography hashes and digital signatures.
- Hashes changes when data is tampered with
- Original senders sign data using digital signatures

## How data are organised
- Arranges data into **groups** or **blocks** that are linked or chained together.
- Timeline of data made automatically with accurate timestamp.
- When block is "filled" it is put into the block chain and merged into this timeline.
